    description: 'The Kubeflow project is dedicated to making deployments of machine
      learning (ML) workflows on Kubernetes simple, portable and scalable. Our goal
      is not to recreate other services, but to provide a straightforward way to deploy
      best-of-breed open-source systems for ML to diverse infrastructures. Anywhere
      you are running Kubernetes, you should be able to run Kubeflow. '
